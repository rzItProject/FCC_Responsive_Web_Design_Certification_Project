                <h2>Key Momments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Childhood and Early Years of Nelson Mandela:</li>
                    <p>Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo, South Africa. Despite growing
                        up in an environment marked by racial inequality and discrimination, Mandela developed a strong
                        sense of justice from an early age. He studied law at university and became a staunch advocate
                        for human rights.</p>
                    <li>The Struggle Against Apartheid:</li>
                    <p>Mandela actively engaged in the fight against apartheid, an institutionalized system of racial
                        segregation that deeply divided South Africa. He co-founded the African National Congress (ANC)
                        in 1912 and initially advocated for peaceful and nonviolent means to advocate for the rights of
                        black South Africans. However, in the face of violent government repression, he eventually
                        endorsed armed resistance to overthrow the racist regime.</p>
                    <li>Imprisonment and Resilience:</li>
                    <p>In 1964, Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the
                        government. During his 27 years of imprisonment, he became a symbol of the struggle against
                        oppression and injustice. His resilience and unwavering belief in justice inspired millions of
                        people worldwide.</p>
                    <li>Release and Legacy:</li>
                    <p>In 1990, after years of international pressure, Mandela was released from prison. He then played
                        a central role in the negotiations that led to the end of apartheid and the democratic election
                        of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's first black president in 1994. Mandela dedicated his
                        presidential term to reconciliation and building a democratic and multiracial nation.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Nelson Mandela will forever remain a symbol of the fight against oppression and injustice. His
                    dedication to freedom, equality, and reconciliation continues to inspire present and future
                    generations. His legacy reminds us of the importance of tolerance, mutual respect, and perseverance
                    in the pursuit of a better world.</p>
